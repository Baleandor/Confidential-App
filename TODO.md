Removed serialized check from redux store to get rid of
non-serializable data error. Error culprit could not be located at the time in measurementsAPI

userChartData - how to give measurements[1] a type?

Couldn't figure out how to store userRole metadata in ExerciseLibrary page.

TYPES FOR FIXING
LineChart.tsx
UserProfile.tsx
All 'throw error', ffs
